# Poster Classification 
In this project i classified movie genres based on the posters that i collected on IMDB. 
I found that the accuracy of the model that I trained was still not good enough, which was 65%. 
The data I trained is 289 poster images which are divided into 5 classes.
maybe one day I will evaluate the model and I will deploy it. **Hell** yeah, enjoy it
